**Descriptive Statistics for Fire Size**:

- **Count**: 2,303,566 
  - This indicates the number of fire records or rows in the dataset.

- **Mean (Average) Fire Size**: 78.16 acres
  - On average, fires covered an area of approximately 78.16 acres.

- **Standard Deviation**: 2,630.83 acres
  - This measures the amount of variation in fire sizes from the average. A large standard deviation indicates that the fire sizes can vary greatly from the average size.

- **Minimum Fire Size**: 0.00001 acres 
  - This is the smallest recorded fire size in the dataset.

- **25th Percentile**: 0.1 acres
  - 25% of the fires in the dataset are 0.1 acres or smaller. This is the size below which a given percentage of observations in a group fall.

- **Median (50th Percentile) Fire Size**: 0.8 acres
  - Half of the fires in the dataset are less than or equal to 0.8 acres in size.

- **75th Percentile**: 3 acres
  - 75% of the fires in the dataset are 3 acres or smaller. Only 25% of fires exceed this size.

- **Maximum Fire Size**: 662,700 acres
  - This is the largest recorded fire size in the dataset.
